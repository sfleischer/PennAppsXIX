  <p class="ph3 fl-ns mb0 mt3 pt1"><span class="dib-l dib-m dn"></span>Engagement+ is a tool enabling TD Bank employees to better engage their customers.  Utilizing customer data and powerful analysis, Engagement+ is able to bring <b>focus</b> to the most important aspects of customer engagement.  Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn APIs are run through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) filter and used to develop a database of positive interests for each customer, allowing representatives to start personalized conversations.  Furthermore, with speech-to-text capabilities, Engagement+ is able to build further interests using the major conversation topics determined by NLP.  By establishing the two-layer interaction, our employees are able to make customer service more friendly and engaging.</p>

  <p class="ph3 fl-ns mb0 mt3 pt1"><span class="dib-l dib-m dn"></span>Engagement+ also incorporates data analytics to empower employees to better understand their customer's banking history, enabling personalized advice.  Firstly, Engagement+ provides a heatmap of customer spending across the entire world.  This map helps employees better understand the context in which their customers spend money.  For example, knowing that a customer spends more money in other countries could lead to discussions about internaional banking credit cards. Furthermore, Engagement+ provides charts and graphs of important banking data while making <b> predictions </b> based on old spending habits.</p>

    <p class="ph3 fl-ns mb0 mt3 pt1"><span class="dib-l dib-m dn"></span>Engagement+ was devevloped by Goat Team for Wharton Undergraduate Financial Tech Hackathon.  Goat Team is comprised of Ranwei Hu, Chris Fischer, Samuel Fleischer, and Derek Leung.</p>
